Each of these tokens represents their shares which open up for trading amongst music fans, friends & social media public interests who can now be music investors globally just like a music label and invest in artists. Every new artist share price on the platform will open and start trading at 0.50 cents per share. Once all four million of their digital asset shares have sold, that artist will be recognized as a major artist on the Valyou X. Before selling any shares, an artist's default profile tier level will be displayed as "new artist." regardless of how famous they already are or who they were before listing on our platform.

Our platform will allow all independent artists to have a significant major type funding through selling their shares to their friend and fans which will enable them to pursue their music career full time and also allow already established artists to generate more revenue from their music through Valyou X. </p>

The underlying technology blockchain integration, in one of the many use cases we are implementing in our passionate, driven journey of disrupting the music industry.  It will allows artists in global regions, living in any country to attract both local and foreign investors into their music careers. It will present all independent artists with the same typical investment and funding opportunity record labels provide to signed mainstream artists.
