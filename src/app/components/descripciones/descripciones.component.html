Once all four million of their digital asset shares have sold, that artist will be recognized as a major artist on the Valyou X.

Our platform will allow all independent artists to have a significant major type funding through selling their shares to their friend and fans which will enable them to pursue their music career full time and also allow already established artists to generate more revenue from their music through Valyou X. </p>

In a concept which implements innovative and data-safe technology secured through a decentralized blockchain. It provides music fans and artists with a transparent, open source ecosystem for trading where anyone can make artists investments. The underlying technology blockchain integration, in one of the many use cases we are implementing in our passionate, driven journey of disrupting the music industry.  It will allows artists in global regions, living in any country to attract both local and foreign investors into their music careers. It will present all independent artists with the same typical investment and funding opportunity record labels provide to signed mainstream artists. This will also provide visibility and a reduction of risk between artists and investors, as it can cost labels up to cost up to $2 Million or more to invest in an artist and break them into the mainstream. Blockchain also allows us to replace the old music business model and revolutionalize it with our new Valyou X music purchase business model. Our vision of creating putting one global music economy inside our pockets aligns with blockchain technology in redefining how and why we connect with music. Allowing anyone, like friends and fans to be able to become music investors will not only create more excitement among music fans but it can also give users a more robust knowledge and understanding around the music economy and a better understanding of the origin of an artist from grass root levels.
